## Associted with the paper titled "Leveraging partial stragglers within gradient coding"

The 'gradient_coding_simulation' directory includes a Jupyter notebook with simulations for both exact and approximate gradient coding. 
Each cell is accompanied by detailed instructions explaining its purpose and how to execute it. 

Additionally, the directory contains intermediate files and generated graphs to facilitate reproducibility.
Another directory, 'lagrange_error,' contains a Jupyter notebook implementing polynomial interpolation using Lagrange polynomials. 
It also includes the 'lagrange.txt' file, which generates the plot featured in the paper.
